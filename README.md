# ip
APS BCDA synApps module: ip

This repository contains support for devices that communicate 
via ASCII (RS232, for example) or the 
[stream device](https://github.com/paulscherrerinstitute/StreamDevice) 
protocol from PSI.  Some such devices have their own repository (such as 
[delayGen](https://github.com/epics-modules/delayGen)) if they support 
a number of related devices or functionality.

The name *ip* is legacy, deriving from the use of Industry Pack cards in a
VME environment to provide the serial or GPIB communications channels.
