# Address will be 2-digit, 0-padded int passed from db

### The error status is a decimal number, so no conversion is necessary
getErrorStatus
{
  out "\$1fs";
  in "%02d";
}

### 
getBuffMode
{
  out "\$1bum";
  in "%{00|01|02}";
}

setBuffMode
{
  out "\$1bum%{00|01|02}";
  in "ok";
  
  @init { getBuffMode; }
}

### Read data from the pyrometer (amount of data depends on buffer mode)
getBuff00Data
{
  out "\$1bup";
  in "%04x";
}

getBuff01Data
{
  out "\$1bup";
  in "%04x%(\$2:temp2Raw)04x%(\$2:temp2cRaw)04x";
}

getBuff02Data
{
  out "\$1bup";
  in "%04x%(\$2:temp2Raw)04x%(\$2:temp2cRaw)04x%(\$2:rampSp)04x%(\$2:ao)04x%(\$2:signal)04x%(\$2:stat0)02x%(\$2:stat1)02x%(\$2:stat2)02x%(\$2:stat3)02x";
}

### get/set focus distance
getMeasDist
{
  out "\$1moa";
  in "%04x";
}

setMeasDist
{
  out "\$1moa%04x";
  in "ok";
  
  @init { getMeasDist; }
}

### Units (0 = Celsius, 1 = Fahrenheit)
getUnit
{
  out "\$1fh";
  in "%d";
}

setUnit
{
  out "\$1fh%d";
  in "ok";
  
  @init { getUnit; }
}

### Read device temperature in Celsius / 256
getDeviceTemp
{
  out "\$1tsc0";
  in "%04x";
}


### Stuff that isn't implemented

# This would be useful for troubleshooting misconfigurations
getDeviceAddress
{
  out "99ga";
  in "%02d";
}

# presumably this changes the temp that is displayed on the screen of the device
setDispTemp
{
  out "\$1an%d";
  in "ok";
}

getDispTemp
{
  out "\$1ar";
  in "%d";
}

setAo1Range
{
  out "\$1as%d";
  in "ok"
}

getAo1Range
{
  out "\$1as";
  in "%d";
}

setAo2Range
{
  out "\$1ar%d";
  in "ok"
}

getAo2Range
{
  out "\$1ar";
  in "%d";
}
