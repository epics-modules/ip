To run the BK9130 with EPICS (RS232):
====================================

RS232 Comms:
  Baud: 9600
     - The device can be set to 4800, 9600, 19.2K, or 38.4K.  I tested at 9600.
  Parity: No
     - The device can be set to Odd, Even, or No Parity.
  Stop bits: 1
  Data bits: 8
  Handshaking: No
  inputEos: LF
  outputEos: LF

Cable:
  db9 DTE   BK9130 db9*
  -------   ----------
     2         2
     3         3
     5         5

* Notes Re. Serial connection:
  1.) This device's db9 connector is NOT RS232.  It is a TTL interface.  
      An adapter needs to be purchased from BK Precision that translates 
      the TTL to RS232.  This adapter is port-powered.  This means that, 
      for a low-power UART like the IP-Octal, +12VDC needs to be connected 
      on the RS232 side of the adapter to db9 pins 4 (+), and 5 (-).
	    
Loading the database, for example:
  # BK Precision 9130 Power Supply
  dbLoadRecords("$(IP)/ipApp/Db/BK9130.db","P=xyz:,PS=1,PORT=serial2")

StreamDevice:
  BK9130.proto must be in "STREAM_PROTOCOL_PATH"

Autosave:
  BK9130_settings.req  (can be used with "configMenu" to save instrument setups)

The arguments for the medm display are simply:
  P=xyz:, PS=1
